#### Runnel
A program to streams any command line output over http.
This is useful when we want to display command output on client side.
One such use case can be, displaying live logs in browser which are running inside a container on server side.


#### Installation:
- Using docker (recommended)

        git clone https://github.com/VeritasOS/runnel.git
        cd runnel

        # build docker image
        docker build -t runnel:latest .

        # start runnel server
        docker run --name runnel -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 runnel:latest

- Using binary (not recommended, because system dependencies are taken care in docker file on behalf of you)

        git clone https://github.com/VeritasOS/runnel.git
        cd runnel

        ./bin/linux_64/runnel_server -p localhost:9090



#### Usage:
- Trigger below commands to get live stream

        # Fire command with curl
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"cmd":"ping -c 3 google.com"}' http://localhost:9090/command

        # Get live output stream
        # replace uuid with one which you get from above command
        while true; do curl -sS -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://localhost:9090/stream/fd4b1a38-94f4-4eba-80e7-50578ac4baae' | jq '.response'; done


#### Library:
- We can use the api directly in golang code
- Install redis server

        # Get lib
        go get github.com/veritasos/runnel/runnel

        # Fire command
        client := runnel.NewClient()
        key, err := client.RunCommand("ping", "-c 2 google.com")

        # Get output stream
        client := runnel.NewClient()
        output, err := client.Stream(key, 10)
